<course number="5200" name="MECHANICAL VIBRATIONS" course_desc="(2 Credits) The course provides fundamentals for vibration analysis of linear discrete and continuous dynamic systems, A vibrating system is first modeled mathematically as an initial value problem (IVP) or a boundary-initial value problem (BIVP) by the Newton-D&apos;Alembert method and/or the Lagrange energy approach and then solved for various types of system. Explicit solutions for dynamic response of a linear single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) system, both damped and undamped, is derived for free-vibration caused by the initial conditions and forced vibration caused by different excitations. Modal analysis is presented to solve for vibration response of both multi-degree-of-freedom (MDOF) systems and continuous systems with distributed parameters. As the basis of modal analysis, the natural frequencies and vibration modes of a linear dynamic system are obtained in advance by solving an associated generalized eigenvalue problem and the orthogonal properties of the vibration modes with respect to the stiffness and mass matrices are strictly proved. Computational methods for vibration analysis are introduced. Applications include but are not limited to cushion design of falling packages, vehicles traveling on a rough surface, multi-story building subjected to seismic and wind loading, and vibration analysis of bridges subjected to traffic loading.

This course specifically  addresses the unique role of biomaterials  in medical device design and the use of emerging  biomaterials technology in medical devices. The  need to understand design requirements of medical devices based on safety and efficacy will be  addressed. Unexpected device failure can occur if  testing fails to account for synergistic interactions  from chronic loading, aqueous environments,  and biologic interactions. Testing methodologies  are readily available to assess accelerated effects of  loading in physiologic-like environments. This  combined with subchronic effects of animal implants  is a potential tool in assessing durability. It  is difficult to predict the chronic effects of the total  biologic environment. The ultimate determination  of safety comes not only from following the  details of regulations, but with an understanding  of potential failure modes and designs that lowers  the risk of these failures.

<course number="1020" name="FORCES AND BONDING" course_desc="Cat. I   We will examine the origin and strength of electrical forces within molecules (covalent bonds), between positive and negative ions in a lattice (ionic bonds),  and between atoms or molecules of a pure substance (intermolecular forces).  Energy changes accompanying the rupture or formation of such bonds will be  discussed.  Specific concepts that we will discuss are:   Molecular Structure and Shape   Gases Solids Intra-and Intermolecular Forces   Liquids   Energy (First Law of Thermodynamics)" min-credits="3"

<course number="1101" name="INTRODUCTION TO PROGRAM DESIGN" course_desc="This course introduces principles of computation and programming with an emphasis on program design. Topics include the design, implementation and testing of programs that use a variety of data structures (such as structures, lists, and trees), functions, conditionals, recursion and higher-­‐order functions. Students will be expected to design simple data models, and implement and debug programs in a functional programming language.       Recommended background: none.  Either CS 1101 or CS 1102 provides sufficient background for further courses in the CS department. Undergraduate credit may not be earned for both this course and CS 1102.

<course number="1102" name="ACCELERATED INTRODUCTION TO PROGRAM DESIGN" course_desc="Cat. I  This course provides an accelerated introduction to design and implementation  of functional programs. The course presents the material from CS 1101 at a fast  pace (so students can migrate their programming experience to functional languages), then covers several advanced topics in functional programming (potential topics include macros, lazy programming with streams, and  programming with higher-order functions). Students will be expected to design, implement, and debug programs in a functional programming language.  Recommended background: prior programming background covering lists,  trees, functions, and recursion.  Undergraduate credit may not be earned for both this course and CS 1101.

<course number="2011" name="INTRODUCTION TO MACHINE ORGANIZATION AND ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE" course_desc="Cat. I  This course introduces students to the structure and behavior of modern digital computers and the way they execute programs. Machine organization topics include the Von Neumann model of execution, functional organization of computer hardware, the memory hierarchy, caching performance, and pipelining. Assembly language topics include representations of numbers in computers, basic instruction sets, addressing modes, stacks and procedures, low-level I/O, and the functions of compilers, assemblers, linkers, and loaders.

<course number="2019" name="SENSORS, CIRCUITS, AND SYSTEMS" course_desc="Cat. I   This course investigates commonly used sensors such as resistive temperature sensors, capacitive touch sensors, and inductive motion sensors and actuators.  Numerous applications are presented to motivate coverage of fundamental  operating principles of circuit elements such as resistors, capacitors, and  inductors; model the signals produced by these sensors; and analyze the circuits  and systems used to amplify and process these signals. After a review of  Kirchhoff ‘s current and voltage laws, fundamental analysis techniques such as  Thevenin and Norton’s theorems and the superposition principle are used to  model and analyze sensors, circuits, and systems. Concepts from analysis of  linear, time-invariant continuous-time signals and systems are introduced as  necessary, including Fourier series and characterization of systems such as filters  in both the frequency domain (bandwidth, transfer function) and time domain  (rise time, step response). Capacitance, inductance and mutual inductance are  explored as energy storage elements, including consideration of resonance and  energy losses in power systems. Concepts will be reinforced with the use of  laboratory exercises and computer simulation.

<course number="2029" name="INTRODUCTION TO DIGITAL CIRCUIT DESIGN" course_desc="Cat. I   Digital circuits are the foundation upon which the computers, cell phones, and calculators we use every day are built. This course explores these foundations by  using modern digital design techniques to design, implement and test digital  circuits ranging in complexity from basic logic gates to state machines that  perform useful functions like calculations, counting, timing, and a host of other  applications. Students will learn modern design techniques, using a hardware  description language (HDL) such as Verilog to design, simulate and implement  logic systems consisting of basic gates, adders, multiplexers, latches, and  counters. The function and operation of programmable logic devices, such as  field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), will be described and discussed in  terms of how an HDL logic design is mapped and implemented. Experiments  involving the design of combinational and sequential circuits will provide  students a hands-on introduction to basic digital electrical engineering concepts  and the skills needed to gain more advanced skills. In the laboratory, students  will construct, troubleshoot, and test the digital circuits that they have developed  using a hardware description language. These custom logic designs will be  implemented using FPGAs and validated using test equipment.  Topics: Number representations, Boolean algebra, design and simplification of combinational circuits, arithmetic circuits, analysis and design of sequential  circuits, and synchronous state machines.  Lab exercises: Design, analysis and construction of combinational and  sequential circuits; use of hardware description languages to implement, test, and verify digital circuits; function and operation of FPGAs.   Recommended background: Introductory Electrical and Computer  Engineering concepts covered in a course such as ECE 2010 or RBE 1001, and  MA 1022.

Using popular everyday devices as case studies, students in  this course are introduced to the unique computing and design challenges posed  by embedded systems. Students will then solve real-world design problems using  small, resource constrained (time/memory/power) computing platforms. The hardware and software structure of modern embedded devices and basic interactions between embedded computers and the physical world will also be  covered in lecture and as part of laboratory experiments. In the laboratory,  emphasis is placed on interfacing embedded processors with common sensors  and devices (e.g. temperature sensors, keypads, LCD display, SPI ports, pulse  width modulated motor controller outputs) while developing the skills needed  to use embedded processors in systems design. This course is also appropriate for  RBE and other engineering and CS students interested in learning about  embedded system theory and design.  Topics: Number/data representations, embedded system design using C,  microprocessor and microcontroller architecture, program development and  debugging tools for a small target processor, hardware/software dependencies,  use of memory mapped peripherals, design of event driven software, time and  resource management, applications case studies.  Lab Exercises: Students will solve commonly encountered embedded  processing problems to implement useful systems. Starting with a requirements  list students will use the knowledge gained during the lectures to implement  solutions to problems which explore topics such as user interfaces and  interfacing with the physical world, logic flow, and timing and time constrained  programming. Exercises will be performed on microcontroller and/or  microprocessor based embedded systems using cross platform development tools appropriate to the target platform.   Recommended Background: ECE 2010 or equivalent knowledge in basic  circuits, devices and analysis; and C language programming (CS 2301 or  equivalent)   Suggested Background: ECE 2029 or equivalent

<course number="2112-C01" name="ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS" course_desc="Cat. I   The object of this course is a comprehensive treatment of electromagnetic engineering principles covering the entire application spectrum from static to  dynamic field phenomena.  The starting point will be the basic electric and magnetic field definitions of Coulomb  and Biot-Savart leading to Gauss’s and Ampere’s laws. They form the foundation of electro- and magnetostatics fields. Students will examine capacitive and inductive  systems and relate them to lumped element circuit models. By introducing tempora l and spatial magnetic flux variations, Faraday’s law is established. The engineering  implications of this law are investigated in terms of transformer and motor actions.  Incorporation of the displacement current density into Ampere’s law and combining it  with Faraday’s law will then culminate in the complete set of Maxwell’s field equations.  As a result of these equations, students will develop the concept of wave propagation in  the time and frequency domain with practical applications such as wireless communication,  radar, Global Positioning Systems, and microwave circuits.

The focus is on ways in which a developing country can increase its productive  capacity, both agricultural and industrial, in order to achieve sustained economic  growth. The course proceeds by first examining how economic growth and  economic development are measured and how the various nations of the world  compare according to well-known social and economic indicators. Theories of  economic growth and theories of economic development are then examined, as  are the various social and cultural structures that are thought to influence  economic progress. The inputs to economic growth and development (land,  labor, capital, entrepreneurial ability, education, technical change), and the  possible distributions of income and levels of employment that result from their use, is considered next. Domestic economic problems and policies such as  development planning, the choice of sectorial policies, the choice of monetary  and fiscal policies, rapid population growth, and urbanization and urban  economic development are then examined. The course concludes with a  consideration of international problems and policies such as import substitution  and export promotion, foreign debt, foreign investment, and the role of  international firms. In conjunction with a traditional presentation of the above  topics, the course curriculum will include the use of computer simulation  models and games. These materials have been formulated with a simulation technique, system dynamics, that has its origins in control engineering and the  theory of servomechanisms. As a result, students will find them complementary  to their work in engineering and science. In addition, the various development theories and simulation and gaming results will be related, where possible, to specific developing nations where WPI has on-going project activities (e.g., Costa Rica and Thailand).

<course number="2600" name="ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD" course_desc=" Cat. II Environment and development are often seen as incompatible, in part because many poor people in the developing world depend directly on natural resources  for their livelihoods. At the same time, poor people are often seen as responsible  for causing environmental degradation because they lack the knowledge, skills  and resources to manage the environment effectively. The vicious circle is  completed as environmental degradation exacerbates poverty. However,  optimists argue that poor people can and do contribute positively to environmental o utcomes, that states and organizations can facilitate their efforts and  that environmental interventions can coincide with development. This course  will examine these different perspectives on environmental problems in the  developing world through the insights and critiques of social science. Subjects  covered include sustainable development, population, environmental risks, gender, urbanization, environmental decision making, and non-governmental  organizations (NGOs).

<course number="2001" name="INTRODUCTION TO MATERIALS SCIENCE" course_desc="Cat. I This beginning course provides important background for all science and engineering disciplines regarding the capabilities and limitations of materials in our everyday lives. Students are introduced to the fundamental theme of materials science-- structure-property-processing relationships—in metals, ceramics, and plastics. Aspects of material structure range from the atomic to microstructural and macroscopic scales. In turn, these structural features determine the properties of materials. In particular, this course investigates connections between structure and mechanical properties, and how working and thermal treatments may transform structure and thus alter material properties. This knowledge is then applied to material selection decisions.      Recommended background: prior knowledge of college-level chemistry.

<course number="2312" name="INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY" course_desc="Cat. II Environmental issues present some of the major international problems and opportunities facing the world today. Worst-case scenarios envision irrevocable degradation of the earth’s natural systems, but virtually every analysis sees the  need for major change worldwide to cope with problems such as global  warming, deforestation, ozone layer depletion, loss of biodiversity, and  population growth, not to mention exponential increases in &quot;conventional&quot;  pollutants in newly industrialized countries. The global environment issues  represent a &quot;second-generation&quot; of environmental policy in which the focus of  concern has moved from national regulations to international law and institutions. In addition, the environment has emerged as a major aspect of  international trade, conditioning corporate investment and accounting for some  $200 billion in sales of pollution control equipment in 1991. Exploration of the  genesis and implications of these phenomena is the essence of the course.  Topically, the material begins with the nature of global environmental problems,  drawing on literature from large-scale global modeling as well as particular  analyses of the problems mentioned above. Approximately half the course  focuses on international laws and institutions, including multilateral treaties  (e.g., the Montreal Protocol limiting CFC use, ocean dumping, biodiversity),  international institutions (UNEP, the Rio Convention, the OECD) and private  initiatives (international standards organizations, ICOLP (Industry Committee for Ozone Layer Protection), etc.) In addition, US policy toward global  environmental issues will be compared with that in Japan, Europe and  developing countries, from which it differs significantly.

Thus, institutions have emerged at the international and  transnational levels to coordinate collective problem solving. But governance  involves more than just the practicality of problem solving; it also involves  uncertainty, controversy, power and politics. This course will examine the ways  in which global environmental governance has been conceived: from establishing  international institutions and agreements, to less tangible ways of interacting.  We will examine themes such as scales of governance (from the United Nations  to communities), policy networks, the role of NGOs, think tanks and special  interests and the role of knowledge in global environmental debates. Students  will then use this conceptual and theoretical basis to analyze major global  environmental issues including: deforestation; biodiversity; endangered species;  and climate change. The goals of this course are to gain an understanding of the  main positions in global environmental debates; critically analyze these  positions; and gain insight into the politics of global environmental policy and  governance.

<course number="1971" name="BRIDGE TO HIGHER MATHEMATICS" course_desc="Cat. I  The principal aim of this course is to introduce and enhance mathematical thinking. The course is intended not only for beginning mathematics, statistics or actuarial students, but also for students seeking to further their mathematical interests and those simply curious about logic and reason. Students in the course will be expected to explain, justify, defend, disprove, conjecture and verify mathematical ideas, both verbally and in writing. One expected by-product of this training is that students will develop concrete proof-writing skills which will improve their prospects for success in more advanced mathematics courses. When appropriate, course discussion will touch on current events in the mathematical sciences, including recently solved problems and open challenges facing today&apos;s scientists.

<course number="3410" name="COMPRESSIBLE FLUID DYNAMICS" course_desc="Cat. I  In this course, students are introduced to various compressibility phenomena such as compression (shock) and expansion waves. Conservation laws and thermodynamic principles are applied to the description of flows in which compressibility effects are significant.

A vibrating system is first modeled  mathematically as an initial value problem (IVP)  or a boundary-initial value problem (BIVP) by the  Newton-D’Alembert method and/or the Lagrange  energy approach and then solved for various types  of system. Explicit solutions for dynamic response  of a linear single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) system,  both damped and undamped, is derived for  free-vibration caused by the initial conditions and  forced vibration caused by different excitations.  Modal analysis is presented to solve for vibration  response of both multi-degree-of-freedom  (MDOF) systems and continuous systems with  distributed parameters.

<course number="5356" name="SMART MATERIALS" course_desc="(2 Credits) A material whose properties can respond to an external stimulus in a controlled fashion is referred to as a smart or intelligent material. These materials can be made to undergo changes modulus, shape, porosity, electrical conductivity, physical form, opacity, and magnetic properties based on an external stimulus.  The stimuli can include temperature, pH, specific molecules, light, magnetic field, voltage and stress. These stimuli-sensitive materials can be utilized as sensors and as vehicles for the controlled delivery of drugs and other biomolecules in medical applications. Smart materials are also becoming important in other biological areas such as bio-separation, biosensor design, tissue engineering, protein folding, and microfluidics. The use of stimuli-sensitive materials is receiving increasing attention in the development of damage tolerant smart structures in aerospace, marine, automotive and earth quake resistant buildings.

Surface  metrology can be important in a wide variety of situations including adhesion, friction, catalysis,  heat transfer, mass transfer, scattering, biological growth, wear and wetting. These situations impact  practically all the engineering disciplines and sciences. The course begins by considering basic  principles and conventional analyses, and methods. Measurement and analysis methods are critically  reviewed for utility. Students learn advanced  methods for differentiating surface textures that  are suspected of being different because of their performance or manufacture. Students will also  learn methods for making correlations between  surface textures and behavioral and manufacturing  parameters. The results of applying these methods  can be used to support the design and manufacture  of surface textures, and to address issues in  quality assurance. Examples of research from a  broad range of applications are presented, including,  food science, pavements, friction, adhesion,  machining and grinding. Students do a major  project of their choosing, which can involve either  an in-depth literature review, or surface measurement  and analysis.

Surface  metrology can be important in a wide variety of situations including adhesion, friction, catalysis,  heat transfer, mass transfer, scattering, biological growth, wear and wetting. These situations impact  practically all the engineering disciplines and sciences. The course begins by considering basic  principles and conventional analyses, and methods. Measurement and analysis methods are critically  reviewed for utility. Students learn advanced  methods for differentiating surface textures that  are suspected of being different because of their performance or manufacture. Students will also  learn methods for making correlations between  surface textures and behavioral and manufacturing  parameters. The results of applying these methods  can be used to support the design and manufacture  of surface textures, and to address issues in  quality assurance. Examples of research from a  broad range of applications are presented, including,  food science, pavements, friction, adhesion,  machining and grinding. Students do a major  project of their choosing, which can involve either  an in-depth literature review, or surface measurement  and analysis. The facilities of WPI’s Surface  Metrology Laboratory are available for making  measurements for selected projects. Software for  advanced analysis methods is also available for use  in the course.

Surface  metrology can be important in a wide variety of situations including adhesion, friction, catalysis,  heat transfer, mass transfer, scattering, biological growth, wear and wetting. These situations impact  practically all the engineering disciplines and sciences. The course begins by considering basic  principles and conventional analyses, and methods. Measurement and analysis methods are critically  reviewed for utility. Students learn advanced  methods for differentiating surface textures that  are suspected of being different because of their performance or manufacture. Students will also  learn methods for making correlations between  surface textures and behavioral and manufacturing  parameters. The results of applying these methods  can be used to support the design and manufacture  of surface textures, and to address issues in  quality assurance. Examples of research from a  broad range of applications are presented, including,  food science, pavements, friction, adhesion,  machining and grinding. Students do a major  project of their choosing, which can involve either  an in-depth literature review, or surface measurement  and analysis. The facilities of WPI’s Surface  Metrology Laboratory are available for making  measurements for selected projects. Software for  advanced analysis methods is also available for use  in the course.

This course is intended to answer the why, what and how of MBSE. The course provides background and motivation for transitioning to MBSE from a document centric approach to systems engineering. The course provides a foundation for MBSE by first introducing SysML as a descriptive language for modeling systems in terms of their requirements, structure, behavior, and parametric constraints. The course then introduces the Object-Oriented Systems Engineering Method (OOSEM) as a method for applying SysML to support the specification, architecture design, analysis, and verification of complex systems.  A systems modeling tool is also introduced and used throughout the course.      Applying MBSE on class projects help the student to grasp the fundamentals. This course is expected to provide the foundations of the systems modeling language, method, and tool to enable the student to get started with MBSE on real projects.
