<course number="522" name="APPLICATIONS OF CALCULUS" course_desc="There are three major goals for this course: to       establish the underlying principles of calculus,       to reinforce studentsâ calculus skills through       investigation of applications involving those skills,       and to give students the opportunity to develop       projects and laboratory assignments for use by       first-year calculus students. The course will focus       heavily on the use of technology to solve problems       involving applications of calculus concepts. In addition,       MME students will be expected to master       the mathematical rigor of these calculus concepts       so that they will be better prepared to develop       their own projects and laboratory assignments.

Models       of this type can be used to examine the possible impacts of policy changes and       technological innovations on socioeconomic systems. The curriculum in this       course is divided into three distinct parts. First, a detailed examination of the       steps of the system dynamics modeling process: problem identification       (including data collection), feedback structure conceptualization, model       formulation, model testing and analysis, model documentation and presentation,       and policy implementation. Second, a survey of the nuts and bolts of      continuous simulation modeling: information and material delays, time      constants, the use of noise and numerical integration techniques, control theory       heuristics, and software details (both simulation and model presentation and       documentation software). Third, a step-by-step, in-class production of a model,       involving the construction, testing, and assembly of subsectors. Students will be       required to complete modeling assignments working in groups and take in-class       quizzes on modeling issues.

How has the being of nature and knowledge of nature been represented in Western philosophy and science? Is knowledge      objective? What constitutes adequate justification for holding a belief? Are different kinds of bodies treated as differently credible in terms of knowledge production? Is it even possible to know anything about the world at all? Metaphysics explores questions concerning the nature and structure of reality, such as: What is the self? Do souls exist? How important are categories such as gender, race, class, and      sexuality in forming our identities? Does God exist? Is reality material, immaterial, or a combination of both? What is time? Am I the same person today that I was yesterday? What kind of a phenomenon is mind or thought and can entities in addition to human beings, such as computers, be said to have this attribute?

Does the history of science, which includes many refutations of theories once believed to be true, raise questions about whether currently accepted theories should be trusted?

What are the sources of those responsibilities? The course will focus both on professional and personal dilemmas and will help students think through some moral problems that are likely to confront them in their professional and personal lives. The class should also help prepare students to navigate through the tough moral issues they are likely to face, either as a medical      professional, a citizen, a parent, a child of parents, or as potentially a sick person themselves. This class proposes to grant students the reflective time to read some of the most eloquent authors on suffering, caretaking, and sickness (for example, Oliver Sacks, Jerome Groopman, Susan Sontag, Leo Tolstoy, Virginia Woolf, Tony Kushner, Tracy Kidder, Perri Klass, etc.) and to express their reflections on these      resources in effective communication.

This course will investigate the many dimensions of spiritual thought and practice, focusing on questions such as: What similarities/differences exist among the spiritual teachings of traditional religions? What is a spiritual experience, a spiritual lesson, a spiritual life? What is the role of spiritual practices such as yoga, meditation, and prayer? What is the place of spirituality in medicine (e.g.,      meditation as treatment for stress), our relation to nature (e.g., the experience of a sunset), and political life (e.g., Gandhi, King, spiritual environmentalism)?

Social media has also allowed people to share resources (financial, expertise, and organizational) with other social actors across the globe, empowering communities in novel ways. This course introduces students to the phenomena of social and environmental movements, theories on why they succeed and fail, and how social media has changed the landscape of social mobilization. This course will draw on interdisciplinary readings, concepts, and case studies from the social sciences, with emphasis on geography, public policy, sociology, and media studies.

<course number="2600" name="ENVIRONM PROBLMS IN DEVEL WRLD" course_desc="      Cat. II      Environment and development are often seen as incompatible, in part because      many poor people in the developing world depend directly on natural resources       for their livelihoods. At the same time, poor people are often seen as responsible       for causing environmental degradation because they lack the knowledge, skills       and resources to manage the environment effectively. The vicious circle is       completed as environmental degradation exacerbates poverty. However,       optimists argue that poor people can and do contribute positively to environmental      o utcomes, that states and organizations can facilitate their efforts and       that environmental interventions can coincide with development. This course       will examine these different perspectives on environmental problems in the       developing world through the insights and critiques of social science.

Numerous applications are presented to motivate coverage of fundamental       operating principles of circuit elements such as resistors, capacitors, and       inductors; model the signals produced by these sensors; and analyze the circuits       and systems used to amplify and process these signals. After a review of       Kirchhoff ‘s current and voltage laws, fundamental analysis techniques such as       Thevenin and Norton’s theorems and the superposition principle are used to       model and analyze sensors, circuits, and systems. Concepts from analysis of       linear, time-invariant continuous-time signals and systems are introduced as       necessary, including Fourier series and characterization of systems such as filters       in both the frequency domain (bandwidth, transfer function) and time domain       (rise time, step response). Capacitance, inductance and mutual inductance are       explored as energy storage elements, including consideration of resonance and       energy losses in power systems.

<course number="2029" name="INTRO TO DIGITAL CIRCT DESIGN" course_desc="Cat. I             Digital circuits are the foundation upon which the computers, cell phones, and      calculators we use every day are built. This course explores these foundations by       using modern digital design techniques to design, implement and test digital       circuits ranging in complexity from basic logic gates to state machines that       perform useful functions like calculations, counting, timing, and a host of other       applications. Students will learn modern design techniques, using a hardware       description language (HDL) such as Verilog to design, simulate and implement       logic systems consisting of basic gates, adders, multiplexers, latches, and       counters. The function and operation of programmable logic devices, such as       field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), will be described and discussed in       terms of how an HDL logic design is mapped and implemented. Experiments       involving the design of combinational and sequential circuits will provide       students a hands-on introduction to basic digital electrical engineering concepts       and the skills needed to gain more advanced skills. In the laboratory, students       will construct, troubleshoot, and test the digital circuits that they have developed       using a hardware description language. These custom logic designs will be       implemented using FPGAs and validated using test equipment.       Topics: Number representations, Boolean algebra, design and simplification of      combinational circuits, arithmetic circuits, analysis and design of sequential       circuits, and synchronous state machines.       Lab exercises: Design, analysis and construction of combinational and       sequential circuits; use of hardware description languages to implement, test,      and verify digital circuits; function and operation of FPGAs.

<course number="2049" name="EMBEDDED COMPUTNG IN ENG DESGN" course_desc="Cat. I             Embedded computers are literally everywhere in modern life. On any given day       we interact with and depend on dozens of small computers to make coffee, run       cell phones, take pictures, play music, control elevators, manage the       emissions and antilock brakes in our automobile, control a home security       system, and so on. Using popular everyday devices as case studies, students in       this course are introduced to the unique computing and design challenges posed       by embedded systems. Students will then solve real-world design problems using       small, resource constrained (time/memory/power) computing platforms. The      hardware and software structure of modern embedded devices and basic      interactions between embedded computers and the physical world will also be       covered in lecture and as part of laboratory experiments. In the laboratory,       emphasis is placed on interfacing embedded processors with common sensors       and devices (e.g. temperature sensors, keypads, LCD display, SPI ports, pulse       width modulated motor controller outputs) while developing the skills needed       to use embedded processors in systems design. This course is also appropriate for       RBE and other engineering and CS students interested in learning about       embedded system theory and design.       Topics: Number/data representations, embedded system design using C,       microprocessor and microcontroller architecture, program development and       debugging tools for a small target processor, hardware/software dependencies,       use of memory mapped peripherals, design of event driven software, time and       resource management, applications case studies.       Lab Exercises: Students will solve commonly encountered embedded       processing problems to implement useful systems. Starting with a requirements       list students will use the knowledge gained during the lectures to implement       solutions to problems which explore topics such as user interfaces and       interfacing with the physical world, logic flow, and timing and time constrained       programming.

This subject is presented from a theoretical viewpoint, however, many practical examples are included that emphasize the limitations of existing protective equipment.  Course content is not specific to any particular manufacturerâs equipment. The course begins with a brief review of the nature of power system operation, power system faults and other abnormal conditions.  The nature and objectives of protective relaying are covered next with emphasis on how the power system can be monitored to detect abnormal conditions. The computational tools needed to analyze system operation and apply protective relaying are covered next, including the per-unit system, phasors and symmetrical components.  The modeling of current transformers under steady-state and transient conditions is presented with emphasis on the impact on protective devices.  A unit on system grounding and its impact on protective device operation is included.  Course emphasis then shifts to protective devices and their principles of operation.  Both electromechanical and numeric relay designs are covered. (Prerequisite:  ECE 5500 Power System Analysis or equivalent background experience is suggested.

<course number="5200" name="MECHANICAL VIBRATIONS" course_desc="The course provides fundamentals for vibration      an alysis of linear discrete and continuous dynamic      systems. A vibrating system is first modeled       mathematically as an initial value problem (IVP)       or a boundary-initial value problem (BIVP) by the       Newton-DâAlembert method and/or the Lagrange       energy approach and then solved for various types       of system. Explicit solutions for dynamic response       of a linear single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) system,       both damped and undamped, is derived for       free-vibration caused by the initial conditions and       forced vibration caused by different excitations.       Modal analysis is presented to solve for vibration       response of both multi-degree-of-freedom       (MDOF) systems and continuous systems with       distributed parameters. As the basis of modal       analysis, the natural frequencies and vibration       modes of a linear dynamic system are obtained       in advance by solving an associated generalized       eigenvalue problem and the orthogonal properties       of the vibration modes with respect to the       stiffness and mass matrices are strictly proved.

<course number="1120" name="CALCULUS II W/ PRELIM TOPICS" course_desc="Cat.I       The topics for integral calculus (MA 1022) are covered in this course: the       concept of the definite integral, the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus,       integration techniques, and applications of integration. Applications include: area, volume, arc length, center of mass, work, force, and exponential growth       and decay. Logarithmic and exponential functions are studied in depth.       Arithmetic and geometric sequences and series will also be covered. Key historical events in the development of integral calculus are examined.      Technology will be used as appropriate to support the material being studied.       This course extends for 14 weeks and offers 1/3 unit of credit. It is designed       for students who would benefit from additional contact hours and who need to       strengthen their mathematical background.

Extensive research       efforts have been expended on understanding       how biologic systems interact with biomaterials.       Meanwhile, controversy has revolved around       biomaterials and their availability as a result of       the backlash to the huge liability resulting from       controversies related to material and processing       shortcomings of medical devices. This course specifically       addresses the unique role of biomaterials       in medical device design and the use of emerging       biomaterials technology in medical devices. The       need to understand design requirements of medical      devices based on safety and efficacy will be       addressed. Unexpected device failure can occur if       testing fails to account for synergistic interactions       from chronic loading, aqueous environments,       and biologic interactions. Testing methodologies       are readily available to assess accelerated effects of       loading in physiologic-like environments. This       combined with subchronic effects of animal implants       is a potential tool in assessing durability. It       is difficult to predict the chronic effects of the total       biologic environment.

These methods take into account diverse learning styles       as well as various technological resources. Topics to be covered include: a brief       history of education; curriculum and course guidelines (Massachusetts       Education Reform and regulations 603 CMR 7.00, state curricular frameworks,       national standards); legal issues; developing a course syllabus; and the issue of       breadth versus depth in course planning and delivery. The course also covers       practical questions of organizing, delivering and assessing a course. This course is      intended primarily for students interested in completing the Massachusetts       requirements for teacher licensing. This program is aimed primarily at majors in       mathematics, physics, chemistry and biology wishing to be licensed to teach in       middle or high school in one of those disciplines.

At the same time that this course reflects       upon a transnational framework for understanding the continuum between U.S.       Latinos and Latin American/Caribbean communities, we closely examine more U.S. based arguments supporting and contesting the use of Latino as an ethnic racial       term uniting all U.S. Latino communities. We examine the ways in which       U.S. Latinos have manufactured identities within dominant as well as counter       cultural registers. In this course, special attention is given to the aesthetics of       autobiography and to how Latino writers experiment with this genre in order to       address changing constructions of immigration, language, exile, and identity.

<course number="3150" name="LIGHT, VISION and UNDERSTANDING" course_desc="Cat. II      By using material from the sciences and the humanities this course examines the      ways in which ideas of knowledge and of human nature have been fashioned.       The specific topics include physical theories about light, biological and       psychological theories of visual perception, and artistic theories and practices       concerned with representation. The mixing of material from different academic       disciplines is deliberate, and meant to counter the notion that human pursuits       are naturally arranged in the neat packages found in the modern university. The       course draws upon the physical and social sciences, and the humanities, to       examine how those fields relate to one another, and how they produce knowledge       and self-knowledge. Cultural as well as disciplinary factors are assessed in this       process.       Light, Vision and Understanding is conducted as a seminar. The diverse       collection of reading materials includes a number of primary texts in different      fields. In addition, the students keep a journal in which they record the results of      numerous individual observations and experiments concerning light and visual       perception. The course can fit into several Sufficiency areas as well as serve as a       starting point for an IQP. There are no specific requirements for this course,       although some knowledge of college-level physics, as well an acquaintance with       the visual arts, is helpful.

<course number="5200" name="MECHANICAL VIBRATIONS" course_desc="(2 Credits)      The course provides fundamentals for vibration analysis of linear discrete and continuous dynamic systems, A vibrating system is first modeled mathematically as an initial value problem (IVP) or a boundary-initial value problem (BIVP) by the Newton-DAlembert method and/or the Lagrange energy approach and then solved for various types of system. Explicit solutions for dynamic response of a linear single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) system, both damped and undamped, is derived for free-vibration caused by the initial conditions and forced vibration caused by different excitations. Modal analysis is presented to solve for vibration response of both multi-degree-of-freedom (MDOF) systems and continuous systems with distributed parameters. As the basis of modal analysis, the natural frequencies and vibration modes of a linear dynamic system are obtained in advance by solving an associated generalized eigenvalue problem and the orthogonal properties of the vibration modes with respect to the stiffness and mass matrices are strictly proved. Computational methods for vibration analysis are introduced. Applications include but are not limited to cushion design of falling packages, vehicles traveling on a rough surface, multi-story building subjected to seismic and wind loading, and vibration analysis of bridges subjected to traffic loading.

The purpose of this course is (1) to provide       students with the basic psychological knowledge needed to understand and       evaluate such important cognitive skills as memory, problem solving, decision       making, and reasoning and (2) to provide students the practical skills and       experience necessary to improve and assess their cognitive performance. Topics      will include but not be limited to memory improvement, study skills, effective       problem solving techniques, creativity, numeracy, making effective choices, risky       decision making, dynamic decision making, intelligent criticism of assumptions       and arguments, and evaluating claims about the mind.
