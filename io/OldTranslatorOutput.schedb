<course number="2902" name="ENZYMES, PROTEINS,  PURIFICTN" course_desc="Cat. I (1/6 unit)This course gives basic practical experimental experience in enzymology, how enzymes work and how to purify them for later use.  These techniques are the foundation the design and production of many therapeutic products. Examples of the types of techniques and experiences included in this course are:• The action and optima of enzyme catalysis• Induction of enzyme production• Quantification and detection techniques for proteins• Extraction and purification of protein from biological material using column chromatography• Identification of compounds using Thin Layer ChromatographyRecommended background: BB 1035 (Biotechnology)or equivalent" min-credits="1.5" max-credits="1.5" grade-type="normal"><section crn="10313" number="B01" seats="20" availableseats="19" max_waitlist="0" actual_waitlist="10" term="201601" part-of-term="B Term"><period type="Lab" professor="Roberts, Louis Anthony" professor_sort_name="Roberts, Louis Anthony" professor_email="look@it.up" days="tue" starts="9:00AM" ends="11:50AM" building="GH" room="206"></period><period type="Lab" professor="Roberts, Louis Anthony" professor_sort_name="Roberts, Louis Anthony" professor_email="look@it.up" days="mon" starts="4:00PM" ends="4:50PM" building="SL" room="402"></period></section><section crn="10335" number="B02" seats="20" availableseats="19" max_waitlist="0" actual_waitlist="10" term="201601" part-of-term="B Term"><period type="Lecture" professor="Roberts, Louis Anthony" professor_sort_name="Roberts, Louis Anthony" professor_email="look@it.up" days="wed" starts="9:00AM" ends="11:50AM" building="GH" room="206"></period><period type="Lecture" professor="Roberts, Louis Anthony" professor_sort_name="Roberts, Louis Anthony" professor_email="look@it.up" days="mon" starts="4:00PM" ends="4:50PM" building="SL" room="402"></period></section><section crn="10336" number="B03" seats="20" availableseats="17" max_waitlist="0" actual_waitlist="10" term="201601" part-of-term="B Term"><period type="Lecture" professor="Roberts, Louis Anthony" professor_sort_name="Roberts, Louis Anthony" professor_email="look@it.up" days="wed" starts="1:00PM" ends="3:50PM" building="GH" room="206"></period><period type="Lecture" professor="Roberts, Louis Anthony" professor_sort_name="Roberts, Louis Anthony" professor_email="look@it.up" days="mon" starts="4:00PM" ends="4:50PM" building="SL" room="402"></period></section></course>
